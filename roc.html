        I was born third out of four children to my mother Josie and father Osborn. I was brought up in the West side of
        Africa, Nigeria from Edo state. I was a very quiet young boy who perfered to hang on my own. I grew up loving
        spaghetti which is still my favorit dish to this day. Red and black are my best colors which you can see me wear
        a lot when I go out sight seeing. Night life is my favorite time of day. I love the comodary, joy, and lights as
        I walk down the street.
      </p>

      <p class="born">
        I had a strong passion for music growing up. The lyrics, the melody, and how it was put together. I love
        listening to music while chilling with others or by myself. I started playing around with lyrics and found that
        I could write them pretty easily. I could hear the beat...the melody in my head as I was writing down the words.
        Along with some help with a few friends, I was able to produce a few songs that I hope will gain exposure and
        put me out there as a singer.

      </p>

        I love honest people. Meeting Corinne was a real experience for me. She was God sent. We met on September 14,
        2021 early in the morning. Before I met Corinne I was really negative about everything in my life. Corinne
        opened me up to see everything in my life in a positive way. She spoke to me about God and it was surprising for
        me because I did not know that other people could be so spiritual. We began speaking spiritually in all aspects
        of our lives...especially after I returned to church and got to know Pastor Amos Onogwu. Together Pastor Amos
        Onogwu and Corinne have led me in a more positive direction in my life. They guide me spiritually and
        emotionally helping me see that there is a brighter future for me and that I have a purpose through God.
      </p>

      <p class="born">
        When I was about 16 years old I was working at a factory that made bread. I was a bit tired one day and when I
        was putting ingredients into the big mixer, I fell and the mixer cut my face open. Someone at the factory tried
        to do first aid on me and then sent me home. Thankfully my mom was a nurse at the time and she was able to tend
        to my wound and stitch up my face. I tried worked in foreign exchange trading for a while. I really enjoy it and
        will most likely get back into it once I have the time to. Foreign exchanging helped me to not be greedy with
        money because I had to be careful and sometimes accept low wins or risk losing all my money. I loved learning
        new ways to understand the exchange and run numbers to make more money at the end of the day. Even when those
        extra earnings were only pennies more.
      </p>

      <p class="born">
        My core and values are integrity, honesty and kindness. I helps others when I can and always am grateful when
        someone offers help to me. At first it was hard to except help from others, but it is what we should do for each
        other without expecting something in return.
      </p>
