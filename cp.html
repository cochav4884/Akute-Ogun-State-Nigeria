        <p class="born">Born to Manuel Padilla and Cynthia Peters on March 24, 1979, in AppleValley, California, I grew
          up
          poor and fully aware. By the age of four, I could decern between the good and bad in people. I knew their true
          intentions. I looked to my parents and other adults in my life to understand why good would be done over bad
          and why bad would be done over good. I remember taking all the good adults did towards others, and started
          building my core beliefs. My core beliefs would eventually be how I would treat others and how I would allow
          them
          to treat me. My core values to this day are: 1) Don't Steal; 2) Don't Cheat; 3) Don't Lie; 4) Don't Hit; 5)
          Don't Call Me Dump. I learned that sometimes you accept what is and make the best of it. I trust with ease and
          look for the good in people, no matter how small it may be. God was in and out of my life depending on who was
          in my life at the time. As a child, adults are responsible for all things that nourish our bodies including
          spiritually. As I became older, I had a lot of resentment towards God for not saving me from bad people. As an
          adult I learned how much He was there for me; I just didn't know it.
        </p>

        <p class="born">
          I met Richie Osborne September 14, 2021. We have been through a lot together and independently.
          Richie Osborne is my biggest supporter when it comes to building a new life and career. I am recently divorced
          from my second marriage. I helped raise many children and had three of my own. I went from a stay-at-home mom
          with multiple skills, jobs, and education on my belt, to a single parent of adult children trying to figure it
          all out again. Richie and I support each other in health, sickness, hobbies, work experience, education, and
          spiritually. We enjoy reading the bible and discussing how we understand what we read. Sometimes we are both
          in sync, others we are helping the other to understand, and then there are times when we have to research what
          we
          read to get a better understanding.
        </p>

        <p class="born">
          The first to graduate from college, I earned my Cosmetology License on September 17, 1998. Gave
          birth to my first child November 26, 1998. Worked many odd jobs since the age of eight through today. I Gave
          birth to my second child July 20, 2001. Attempted college a second time and had to resign. Started a daycare
          after giving birth to my third child on April 17, 2003. Along with daycare I worked on hair and nails to help
          pay for bills. I later attempted college again and had to resign again. I focused on raising my kids and
          helping
          others with theirs until my kids started entering school. I then became an avid volunteer earning me a
          honorary
          award for most hours volunteered that school year. It was a book made by the preschool students that had the
          words they learned to spell that year. Once my kids were all above four years old, I earned my school bus
          driver's license. I drove school buses in both the state of California, United States, and the state of Idaho,
          United States.
        </p>

        <p class="born">
          After returning home from Idaho, United States, I chose to go back to school for the third time.
          This time I was successful. I received certificates for two majors. The first in Social Science with a
          concentration in Political Science and Government. The second was in Sociology. I took real interest in
          Anthropology course. My interest was piqued once we started learning about local tribes and how the western
          ways
          began affecting their way of life. I have always been into people, how they function as a group and
          individually. My biggest interest are the rolls people take within group settings and how each roll is an
          important part of keeping the entirety of the group working cohesively. By this time my kids were old enough
          to
          volunteer alongside me within our community. As time went on most of what we had been doing was placed on
          their
          school records as community volunteer hours.
        </p>

        <p class="born">
          I attempted college again years later in 2020 and 2021, but unfortunately was forced to take a
          leave of absence both times due to covid related struggles and homelessness. i recently came off of being
          homeless January 21, 2022. My poor vehicle has more interior wear than it should, but we made it through our
          third time being homeless since this pandemic started. My good friend Richie was a big part of this last
          year. He helped me through some very tough times.
        </p>

        <p class="born">
          February 19, 2022, I was contacted by an employee who works for Bitwise Industries and told about
          their Bitwise Workforce Training classes in coding for web design. At first it seemed too good to be true, but
          after a one on one with this person, I took the opportunity to start classes. My very first look at coding was
          February 23, 2022. Like LEGOS and Minecraft before this, I took to learning and creating within days of seeing
          coding. I learned so quickly that I was fortunate to help others who were struggling with coding. I have
          prepared for this moment my whole life. Every time I played a strategic board game, read mysteries, worked
          puzzles, moved into LEGO play and then introduced to Minecraft...I was being groomed for the best skill I have
          ever learned...coding for web design. My first course was in Website for Beginners, I am currently in Mobile
          Friendly and this is my final project to present at the end of this course. I will continue with
          JavaScript for Beginners and move on to the final course React. By the end of this course, I hope to have this
          website fully functioning and on the internet!
