      <h2>Residents Respond To: How has the Heartbeat of God changed you?</h2>
      <p>
        <b class="text-secondary">Israel Alex obiorah</b> "Heartbeat of God (HBG) has greatly changed my faith life and
        also opened my eyes to a deeper understanding about the removal Judgement.. That's having no form of
        justification of being right or wrong but rather enabling the peace and love that was shed by our lord Jesus
        Christ on our behalf. In which that we are expected to share the same love with our neightbors that Jesus shared
        fo us.. With all this I'm really glad to testify taht I have been enhanced to deal with challenges that might
        seem difficul in times of trials and conditions setting my mind to trust the process by working in alignment
        with God."
