          <b class="text-secondary">Israel Alex obiorah </b> "Heartbeat of God (HBG) has greatly changed
          my
          faith life and
          also opened my eyes to a deeper understanding about the removal Judgement.. That's having no form of
          justification of being right or wrong but rather enabling the peace and love that was shed by our lord Jesus
          Christ on our behalf. In which that we are expected to share the same love with our neightbors that Jesus
          shared
          fo us.. With all this I'm really glad to testify taht I have been enhanced to deal with challenges that might
          seem difficul in times of trials and conditions setting my mind to trust the process by working in alignment
          with God."

          business."

          <br>
          <br>

          <b class="text-secondary">Richie Osborne</b> "First of all I would say I am really happy I met the man of God,
          Pastor Amos Onogwu. He has been a shephard, a teacher, and a father to me. The Heartbeat of God (HBG) has
          immensely changed me from darkness to light. I have been under the influence of the devil for a long time.
          This
          influence was things like anger, fear, judgement (quick to judge people), depression, and a lot more till I
          came
          across this faith. With a solid doctrine of REMOVAL OF JUDGEMENT, trust me it sounds simple and not much till
          I
          started applying this in all aspects of my life, and with the steady back up of the man of God...my life
          transformed into a new one in Christ Jesus. Now I can totally feel the touch of God in my life and that
          brought
          about peace of mind, boldness, love, joy, and so much that the Lord has added to my life. So I would say it is
          a
          great achievement being a disciple in the Heartbeat of God (HBG)."
