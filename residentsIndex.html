                        there
                        about, I came out of my house wanting to go get a snack. Because it was dark outside, I was in a hurry
                        to go get what I needed. Immediately, exiting my house I felt a presence and got chilled and
                        goosebumps
                        all over my body. When I looked to the left, it was really dark, but I can swear I saw a human figure.
                        But this one was looking so old and haggard with a long staff. There was no face and I was just
                        dumb-founded. I couldn't move for a few seconds. My heart was racing and I quickly went back inside my
                        house. I could not even talk to anyone or explain what I had just seen. That was the most scary moment
                        of my life."
